# Matlab_to_python
This project will take some matlab code and convert into python code

What this code does, is it will take in the maximum wave height data

Next, it will fit the data to a distrubution curve

Then it will return the locaation and the scale of that distrubtuion curve.

Then, it will calculate the a "maximum value over R years" 

So an example is, say i give it 20 years of data, then I can tell it "over the course of 10 years (or 100) what is the highest probability maximum value" 


It will return a single number
